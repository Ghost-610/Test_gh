                    A command line interface (CLI) provides a text-based way to interact with your computer and execute
                    various commands. It is often used for running development tools, managing project dependencies, and
                    automating tasks.
                    Depending on your operating system, you may already have a built-in command line interface (such as
                    Terminal on macOS or Command Prompt on Windows). Alternatively, you can use a more feature-rich
                    terminal emulator like iTerm2 or PowerShell.
                    By installing these essential tools, you will have a solid foundation to start your web development
                    journey. Remember to consult the documentation and resources provided by each tool to fully
                    understand their features and capabilities. Happy coding!
